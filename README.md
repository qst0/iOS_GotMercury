Learning iOS, Xcode and Swift (Day 5)

Inspired and requested by [Turtle Island Restoration Network](https://seaturtles.org/):

Good news and bad news,

Bad news: I'm not going to be finishing an app today ðŸ˜¢

Good news: I've been given my first for-real iOS project and it's for a great cause!

Today without any tutorials or guide, only online resources and stackover flow etc,

I created an auto-layout read design for the new Got Mercury iOS App

I'll add more about it as I continue development, but today is a busy busy day for me.
